# ChunkData.py shows how to get chunk data on an image, either from
# the nodemap or from the image itself. It relies on information provided in
# the Enumeration, Acquisition, and NodeMapInfo examples.
#
# It can also be helpful to familiarize yourself with the ImageFormatControl
# and Exposure samples. As they are somewhat shorter and simpler, either
# provides a strong introduction to camera customization.
#
# Chunk data provides information on various traits of an image. This includes
# identifiers such as frame ID, properties such as black level, and more. This
# information can be acquired from either the nodemap or the image itself.
#
# It may be preferable to grab chunk data from each individual image, as it
# can be hard to verify whether data is coming from the correct image when
# using the nodemap. This is because chunk data retrieved from the nodemap is
# only valid for the current image; when GetNextImage() is called, chunk data
# will be updated to that of the new current image.

        # no parameters and gives us a list of INodes. Since we want these INodes
        # to be of type CEnumEntryPtr, we can use a list comprehension to
        # transform all of our collected INodes into CEnumEntryPtrs at once.
